The YCNCC 2025 Spring Symposium and Yale Climate Day poster session showcased an exceptional array of innovative research across multiple disciplines researching AI applications for natural climate solutions. 

🥉 I’m honored to have been awarded third place for my presentation — a moment of recognition that means a lot as I continue refining this work.

🛰️ The past few months have been truly transformational — I’ve been diving deep into a project that brings together Remote Sensing, Economics, and AI for Climate. It’s been both a challenge and a joy to work at the intersection of these fields I’m passionate about.

🌲 Huge thanks to the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture for the opportunity to present alongside so many inspiring and impactful projects. Excited for what’s next!
