I supported professor Eli Fenichel with teaching this course. I had weekly office hours where I helped students with the theory covered in class, problem sets, and consulted them with their course projects.

Excellence as at Teaching Fellow, 2025
======
I received a teaching excellence award for teaching this course! The award was announced at the graduation ceremony on May 19th.

Course Description:
======

The course is designed to familiarize students with concepts and tools for valuing ecological structures (broadly defined) as forms of capital with a specific link to quantitative measures that may be useful in assessing sustainability. We take an economic perspective in this class.  By the end of the class, students will have a working knowledge of concepts necessary to apply capital theory to ecosystems (based on natural resource economics) and will develop a skill set sufficient to build dynamic bioeconomic models that can help them approximate the value of changes in ecosystems. Students will also learn approaches to calculating values of natural capital and measuring sustainability under current conditions. Students will learn tools in dynamic optimization, which may be useful for forward-looking decision making.
